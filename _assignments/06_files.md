The lab guide (including assignment questions) is available above.

The practice mid-term questions do not need to be submitted and you can get the answer by just running the code in most cases.

Please submit your solutions to this assignment via the course brightspace as a jupyter notebook in .ipynb format (as described at the start of the lab guide).
