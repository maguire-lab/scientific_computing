policies:
  - Late assignments will be penalized at 20% per day
  - Assignments submitted after five days will still be evaluated if you would like feedback, although the final grade will still be zero.
  - Late submissions without penalty will be considered only if there are appropriate accomodations in place.
  - Student declarations of absence will not be accepted (although the lowest 2 practical grades will be dropped).
  - TA office hours are only available (without explicit permission) if you attended that week's practical sessions.
